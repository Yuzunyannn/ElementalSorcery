es.tutorial.3_8_0.describe=Book on the Enchantment Table can be separated from it using an Kyanite Pickaxe with Ender Element.\nEnchantment Book carry a considerable amount of Knowledge Element, making them the best way to obtain Knowledge Element currently.\nAdditionally, due to the complexity of the Enchantment Table, never use a low-level Disintegration Box directly on it, or you'll regret it.
es.tutorial.3_8_1.title=Incantation Paper
es.tutorial.3_8_1.describe=Incantation paper combines spells and elements well, making it the specialized paper for crafting Spellbook.
es.tutorial.3_9_0.title=Spellbook Cover
es.tutorial.3_9_0.describe=The cover and back cover of the Spellbook.\nThe cover of a Spellbook is no cheap material.
es.tutorial.4_0_0.title=Small Disintegration Altar
es.tutorial.4_0_0.describe=While the Material Disintegration Box can disintegrate material into Elements, it can only extract one type of Element from the material, and moreover, the conversion rate is extremely low. To address this issue, scholars have designed the Small Material Disintegration Altar, to disintegrate material and obtain more elements.\nThe usage of this Altar is similar to that of the Element Craft Altar. Place the material on the central table, and activate the craft with the disintegration mantra from the Spellbook of Launcher.
es.tutorial.4_10_0.title=Disintegration Altar
es.tutorial.4_10_0.describe=Although the Small Disintegration Altar is useful, both its efficiency and the items it can disintegrate are limited. Scholars have injected a large amount of End Element into the Altar to form a more advanced Disintegration Altar to make it work.\nThe Disintegration Altar has higher disintegration efficiency, can accommodate more cubes, and can also place Structural Crystal on the Magic Platform for calibrated disintegration.
es.tutorial.4_11_0.title=Vortex
es.tutorial.4_11_0.describe=Vortex is essential for effectively merging various items together, and it's a prerequisite for crafting certain items.\nYou can obtain the Vortex through Research.

es.tutorial.4_11_1.describe=If the device for Disintegration is made in the form of a windmill, it can automatically disintegrate element. Thus, the Disintegration Windmill is born.\nBuild a other Disintegration Altar with a 'Windmill Platform' and place the 'Wind Wheel' on it. Driven by the wind, the windmill starts working, converting the surrounding matter into Element and storing them in the element containers around the altar.\nThe stronger the wind, the faster it rotates, and the higher the disintegration efficiency.\nOver time, the Wind Wheel will consume durability until it is destroyed. Wind Wheel made of different materials have different durabilities, and their characteristics also have slight differences.\nThe scholar next door used the Wind Wheel  as weapon. If you don't have that much strength, the juice of Earth Element can help you.
es.tutorial.4_12_0.title=Recursive Structure
es.tutorial.4_12_0.describe=The complexity of items varies, and not all items can be directly analyzed. Therefore, the 'Crafting Structure Recorder' will be your best helper for analyzing complex items.\nReplace the 'Magic Platform' beneath the Structure Analysis Altar with a Crafting Structure Recorder, and use items to calibrate the synthesis structure in the Crafting Structure Recorder to analyze the corresponding content. Of course, this requires that all items used as synthesis items can be individually analyzed by the Structure Analysis Altar, but in practice, this is usually not the case. Fortunately, scholars have solved this problem by building multiple pillars around the Structure Analysis Altar. As long as the Structural Crystal recording the structure of the item is placed in the box of the pillar, it can be read by the Structure Analysis Altar, thus completing the structure recording.
es.tutorial.4_13_0.title=Demarcaterminal

es.tutorial.4_19_0.title=Sky Altar
es.tutorial.4_19_0.describe=Crafted with the wisdom of many scholars, the large altar boasts remarkable design and construction, capable of executing various functions, even replacing some previous altars.\nThe Sky Altar provides an additional 16-grid crafting space, allowing for the creation of more advance devices. It can also conduct items disintegration with minimal loss and even re-construct item based on elements and structure.\nThe Element Square Table is the core of the Sky Altar, capable of performing various functions. Even without the blessings of a altar, the table can still be used as a regular workbench, although the cost of crafting it is quite high.
es.tutorial.4_1_0.title=Architectural Crystal
es.tutorial.4_1_0.describe=Due to the complexity of large Altar structures, scholars have discovered a crystal known as the Architectural Crystal. It is enchanted with the Elf Crystal, can store structural data. Therefore, it is widely used to record altar structures.\nThe device in your hand has the ability to write data for recording: select a Building, then click the first button on the left.\nEnchanting Condition: in the desert, with over 320 blocks dropped on the ground around.
es.tutorial.4_1_1.title=Spellbook of Architecture
es.tutorial.4_1_1.describe=The Spellbook of Architecture can read the building information stored in the Architectural Crystal. By charge Earth Elements on the Magic Desk, using architectural mantra, items from the inventory can be sent to designated locations to quickly complete the building.\n(Architectural Crystal containing building data can be marked with a building anchor point by using Shift Right Click).

The ruler can be dyed with dye at the workbench.)\nThe Architectural Altar can scan the delineated area and record the building data in the Architectural Crystal.\nPlace an empty Architectural Crystal on the Architectural Analyzer, and place the Magic Ruler with delineated areas on the Magic Platform. Activate it with the Spellbook of Launcher to consume Earth Element for recording.\nThe Architectural Altar should be oriented towards the center of the area and not too far away to function properly.\nNote: If the working Architectural Analyzer encounters abnormalities, it may explode.
es.tutorial.4_2_1.title=Frequency Induct
es.tutorial.4_2_1.describe=Throw Crystals of different frequencies around the Frequency Resonator. Place item that can resonate in the Frequency Inductor, and it will start scanning. When the vibration curve of surrounding Crystals and that of a specific data match within a margin of error for 1.6 seconds, the data will be written into the resonating item.\nEach crystal provides 1 amplitude.\n(The margin of error increases over time. Currently, only supports building and Parchment.)
es.tutorial.4_3_0.title=Soul Killer
es.tutorial.4_3_0.describe=The Soul Killer, after killing most creatures, will collect their souls into the sword. As a certain type of soul is collected more, the sweeping damage and range against that type of creature will slowly increase.\nRight Click will consume 1 point of all types of souls to heal oneself.\nThe durability of the Soul Killer is very low, but every kill will fully restore its durability.\nYou need a wooden sword with exactly 666 soul power to craft it.
es.tutorial.4_4_0.title=Blessing Jade Fragment
es.tutorial.4_4_0.describe=This is a precious item that everyone desires to obtain. It not only brings 'blessings' to the holder but also seems to have some connection to the history of ancestors.\nHowever, it's not so easy to acquire; you need to collect 8 pieces to craft it. Although you may not need it at the moment, it's handy to collect these fragments. \nSpeaking of 'blessings,' it seems it can bring you good luck, such as increasing mining drops, unexpectedly restoring life when health is low, and so on.\nThe methods to obtain different fragments vary. Here are some clues:\n1: Seal Stone\n2: Soul Killer\n3: Merchant\n4: Fishing\n5: Smelting\n6: Research\n7: Smelting\n8: Quest
es.tutorial.4_5_0.title=Refract Gem

es.tutorial.4_5_1.title=Void Container
es.tutorial.4_5_1.describe=The weapon enchanted with 'Gather Souls' has a chance to drop Void Fragment when killing End creatures in the End. By putting Dimensity, Void Fragment, Refract Gem, End Pearl into Melt Cauldron in a ratio of 9:9:6:12, you can smelt Void Container.\nThe Void Container seems to have an unconventional capacity. By using it with Element Crystal to make Element Void Container, it can store a single element almost infinitely using the power of the void. However, this storage is unstable, and there's a high risk of elemental leakage and explosion upon impact, so it cannot replace Element Crystal.
es.tutorial.4_6_0.title=Crystal Garden
es.tutorial.4_6_0.describe=A Garden constructed with magic can grow various crops and even crystals. The most essential part of a garden is the 'Life Flower' made with the Star Seed, which provides energy for the surrounding land growth.\nThe Life Flower can only be placed on top of a Magic Pot and requires magic to work. Use Dimensity to replenish magic to the soil (hold a Dimensity and Right Click on the flowerpot).\nEach time the Life Flower provides energy to the surroundings, there is a 2%% chance of consuming magic from the flowerpot.\nLived soil is the basic composition of the crystal garden soil, where various plants can be grown. With the effect of the Life Flower, plants thrive.\nAt the same time, Lived soil can incorporate the 'Essence of Life' from plants. With the effect of the Life Flower, soil containing the 'Essence of Life' will automatically generate plants and grow.\n(Lived soil and plant seeds can be crafted into soil with the 'Essence of Life'. Once destroyed, the 'Essence of Life' in the soil will disappear).
es.tutorial.4_7_0.title=Resonant Incubation
es.tutorial.4_7_0.describe=Scholars have discovered that all crystals have a frequency attribute. Through resonance between crystals in the Resonance Incubator, the frequency of the Lived Soil is adjusted. Once the frequency matches that of a certain crystal, the 'Essence of Life' of that crystal will sprout in the soil. This soil can grow crystal flowers in the Crystal Garden.\n(After each crystal flower matures, there is a certain chance that the 'Essence of Life' will disappear)
es.tutorial.4_7_1.title=Structural Crystal
es.tutorial.4_7_1.describe=The Structural Crystal is a crystal that can store item's structure. In the Structure Analyzer, element's data can be saved the into it.\nThis crystal can be craft through Resonance Incubator.
es.tutorial.4_8_0.title=Magic Terminal
es.tutorial.4_8_0.describe=The device in your hand is a very valuable item. Look for more in the 'Seal Stone', use the 'Mill Hammer' to crush them, and you can get some useful items. Although today's scholars don't fully understand how these things work, they have still managed to craft some useful devices.
es.tutorial.4_9_0.title=Structure Analysis
es.tutorial.4_9_0.describe=If you want to know what elements are contained in an item, you'll need to set up a Structure Analysis Altar.\nPlace a Magic Platform underneath and put the item on it. After a moment, you'll be able to see the element's information of the item on the Structure Analyzer table above.
es.tutorial.5_0_0.title=Item Construction
es.tutorial.5_0_0.describe=Item can be disintegrated into elements, and conversely, elements should be able to construct item. This requires the Sky Altar.\nBelow the Sky Altar, place a Structural Crystal indicating the item to be constructed. At the four corners of the central 9 slots of the table, place Order Crystals. Then, activate the construct-craft with the construct mantra from the Spellbook of Launcher.\nHowever, it seems that the Sky Altar may not be able to handle items of high complexity.\nOrder Crystal can be craft through Resonance Incubator.
es.tutorial.5_10_0.title=Invert
es.tutorial.5_10_0.describe=Blending blessings and calamities, and infusing the power of swirling elements into a gem, it may seem ordinary, but it possesses incredible force...\nAncestors once hinted at the possibility of enhancing power with elements, and there seems to be a subtle connection to this gem.\nScholars refer the force as 'Invert'.
es.tutorial.5_11_0.title=Icerock Creation
es.tutorial.5_11_0.describe=After obtaining it from the elves, the Dragon Breath Pickaxe, when used to mine Scarlet Crystal Ore, drops blue crystal fragments we called 'Ice Rock'. Scholars regard these crystals as a peculiar medium, seemingly not of natural origin.\nThey've melted them together with Invert Gem, resulting in 'Ice Rock Crystals'. These crystals possess extraordinary properties, Can confuse stable elements, allowing them to be stored in a unified form of quantity and energy, we call this unified form as 'Fragment' form. It's truly a groundbreaking discovery.
es.tutorial.5_12_0.title=Crystal Tower
es.tutorial.5_12_0.describe=To create a 'Magic Energy Controller Pedestal' place an 'Icerock Crystal Block' on top of it to construct an Icerock Crystal Tower. The tower can store magical energy in the form of fragments and control its input and output. Connecting it to a magic device can serve as a massive energy storage unit. Right Clicking on the pedestal to retrieve the controller, you can then use the controller to attack enemies. Additionally, the crystal tower can launch secondary strikes using magic. When the tower exceeds a certain height, you can establish remote transmission nodes with the controller.\nThe crystal tower exhibits void characteristics, disregarding spatial transmission. The relationship between storage capacity and height is not linear, leaving scholars puzzled.
es.tutorial.5_13_0.title=Instant Material Construction
es.tutorial.5_13_0.describe=The Element Square Table can perform material construction, but it's slow, and due to the limited number of 'Order Crystals,' it can't construct overly complex things. Thus, the Instant Construction Stela was born. When paired with the corresponding altar, it can instantly construct items recording in 'Structural Crystal' held. With the help of 'Void Container' the Instant Construction Stela can nearly infinitely accommodate 'Order Crystal' When the current capacity exceeds the limit, the capacity will automatically and permanently increase.\nHowever, 'Order Crystal' cannot be directly placed in, they need to be thrown into the surrounding 'Magic Quartz Crock' where they are then transferred into the Instant Construction Stela under the influence of magic fragment energy beams.
es.tutorial.5_14_0.title=Instant Material Collapse
es.tutorial.5_14_0.describe=Both the Disintegration Altar and the Element Square Table have excessively slow item disintegration speeds. However, the Material Collapse Stela, constructed with Element Stone and a large amount of End Element, can quickly disintegrate items. Simply Right Clicking to place items inside it will immediately disintegrate them into elements stored in nearby element containers.\nWhile the Collapse Altar boasts extremely fast disintegration speeds and can even be linked to funnels for automatic disintegration, it still has some drawbacks.\nFirstly, its disintegration output efficiency falls between that of the Element Square Table and the Disintegration Altar. Secondly, repeatedly disintegrating a series of element will overload the Stela, significantly reducing the efficiency of element production.\nWhen the overload exceeds the limit, a collapse explosion occurs. Placing a Blessing Gem on the platform below can provide overload protection, while a Calamity Gem will have the opposite effect.
es.tutorial.5_15_0.title=Collapse
es.tutorial.5_15_0.describe=There are always scholars eager to attempt overloading the Collapse Stela. Surprisingly, its explosion yields a substance with the power to induce collapse in other materials, albeit highly unstable and causing continuous destruction of surrounding blocks. Fortunately, it seems to have no effect on living beings.
es.tutorial.5_15_1.title=Collapse Wand
es.tutorial.5_15_1.describe=The Collapse Wand, formed by integrating Collapse into the Magic Blast Wand, allows for the controlled release of power. It can directly disintegrate blocks in the world into elements and store them, although the disintegration efficiency is not particularly high.
es.tutorial.5_1_0.title=Explore Dust
es.tutorial.5_1_0.describe=The information obtained through Seek Dust is limited. Through more elements, Explore Dust produced can have strong resonance with the surrounding and detect resources contained in the underground.
es.tutorial.5_1_1.title=Calamity Gem
es.tutorial.5_1_1.describe=Through communication with the elves, many monsters were summoned, and numerous precious items were collected from these monsters. It seems to be associated with a certain calamity, but that's not important. By fusing these items together, a terrifying gem was created. Despite its value, few are willing to possess it, for it brings 'Calamity' to its holder.\n'Calamity' causes blocks you break not to drop, makes you a prime target for monsters, and subjects you to constant misfortune like being struck by lightning and more.\nIf you carry a high level of 'Calamity,' you are nearing death.
es.tutorial.5_20_0.title=Starry Invert
es.tutorial.5_20_0.describe=If the Invert Reaction is controllable, converting elements into element fragment and then into elements theoretically allows for the free control of the quantity and power of elements. Through the manipulation of time power to control the Invert Reaction, and with the endless storage core stored in the void, the process is completed.\nThe completed core is even more powerful than expected. It not only allows for element reactions but also serves as a powerful mantra launch platform. Therefore, a more powerful Starry Altar is required to support it.\nThe Starry Altar must be exposed to the open sky. During the reaction process, it sequentially absorbs or releases elements into the surrounding element containers and consumes element fragment in the core to produce unstable fragment. Timely adjustment of the crystal input energy directly facing the core position can convert unstable fragment back into element fragment. In the absence of unstable fragment, the Power Line gradually increases, resulting in higher energy output over time.\nWhen the core absorbs different elements from its interior, its stability decreases. The lower the stability, the more unknown reactions occur, leading to the conversion of the same element fragment into more unstable fragment. Once the unstable fragment exceed the container capacity, they are released. Timely adjustment of the crystal output energy directly facing the core position can convert unstable fragment into magic fragment for output.\nAround the altar, Mantra Gem can be placed. When the core element type is satisfied, corresponding mantra can be activated, and Natural Crystal carried on the body can be used for positional calibration.
es.tutorial.5_2_0.title=Refract Altar
es.tutorial.5_2_0.describe=Through the injection of a large number of Ender Elements, Refract Altar has the power to distort the space which can transfer Steves from one position to another.\nPut the Element Cube with Ender Element on the stone pillars of the altar. Put Natural Crystal with dimension position information into Refract Altar. It will consume Ender Element to open portal.\nMore elements are consumed when the gate is opened, and a relatively small number of elements are consumed after the gate is opened.\nNo sundries are allowed near the opening position of the portal, otherwise the portal may not be opened.
es.tutorial.5_3_0.title=Fusion Crystal
es.tutorial.5_3_0.describe=By merging many crystals together through a vortex, a Fusion Crystal is formed. \nHolding it seems to slightly enhance attributes.
es.tutorial.5_3_1.title=Element Stone
es.tutorial.5_3_1.describe=The stone produced by the fusion of various materials in the vortex possesses remarkable power. It can serve as an element container, storing up to four types of elements. When held, the stone may consume internal elements to produce some magical effects.
es.tutorial.5_4_0.title=Element Dispatch
es.tutorial.5_4_0.describe=The Devolve Cube can scan and manage element containers within a 32*32 area centered around itself. It can absorb and distribute elements within the region.\nWithin the control bar that appears after selecting an element container, left-clicking the transfer button initiates a single transfer, while right-clicking enables continuous automatic transfer.\nAlthough transfer quantities can be set, automatic transfers have a maximum bandwidth per second, and this transfer amount is also used as a priority.
es.tutorial.5_5_0.title=Element Quill
es.tutorial.5_5_0.describe=The Element Quill, formed by the fusion of the Fire Quill and the Water Quill in the vortex, is an essential tool for writing advanced spells.\nThe blended elements are unstable, so it's advisable to only use it for writing spells and avoid using it elsewhere.
es.tutorial.5_5_1.title=Mantra Paper
es.tutorial.5_5_1.describe=The Magical Written Paper, formed by writing glyphs on Incantation Paper using the Element Quill. When on the ground, it absorbs elements from nearby element containers on the same layer to accumulate energy. Once the energy reaches a certain value, the Magical Written Paper sheds its glyphs and evolves into a Mantra Paper.\nThe Mantra Paper is essential for crafting Grimoire.
es.tutorial.5_6_0.title=Grimoire
es.tutorial.5_6_0.describe=The Grimoire, as the most advanced spellbook, resonates elements with matrans, allowing for the casting of various spells. Of course, crafting it is not simple, as it requires expensive materials. Increasing the quantity of 'Mantra Paper' in the middle column enhances the Grimoire's capacity to hold more Mantras.\nThe crafted Grimoire is blank and cannot cast spells. For this purpose, you'll need the Transcribe Altar to inscribe the Mantra into the Grimoire. Moreover, the Transcribe Altar can charge the Grimoire with elements, enabling the mantra to be cast properly.\nDuring the process of unscrambling Ancient Paper, you may discover some content related to Mantra. If you manage to gather a certain kind of Mantra, placing it into the Transcribe Altar along with the Grimoire on the table, and under the entanglement of Knowledge, Fire, and Water elements, you can transcribe the Mantra recorded on the ancient paper into a usable spell for the Grimoire and write it into the Grimoire.\nIf nothing is placed in the Transcribe Altar, and only the Grimoire is placed on the table, the altar will automatically absorb all surrounding elements and infuse them into the Grimoire.\nCasting Mantra consumes certain elements. Multiple spells can be stored in one Grimoire, which depends on the Grimoire's capacity, and you can switch between them using the 'Function Key' (default TAB).
es.tutorial.5_7_0.title=Tangible Mantra
es.tutorial.5_7_0.describe=Once Mantra are transcribed into the Grimoire, they can be cast. But can Mantra be transcribed into items to create items imbued with certain mantra power? Scholars have created Mantra Gem for this purpose.\nThrough the Transcribe Altar, mantra can be written into Mantra Gem.
