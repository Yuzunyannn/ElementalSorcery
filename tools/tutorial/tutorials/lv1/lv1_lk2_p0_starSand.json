        "en_US": "Sand formed by long-term exposure to starlight, is a valuable material. It is difficult to a whole star sand in overworld, but Star Stone can be found above sand. Perhaps you can put the collected multiple star stones into the Stone Mill, and then use a hammer to mash the Star Stone to Star Sand.(shift + Right Click to take out)\\nIn addition, it is said that this kind of Star Stone seems to be more abundant on the sand dunes."
