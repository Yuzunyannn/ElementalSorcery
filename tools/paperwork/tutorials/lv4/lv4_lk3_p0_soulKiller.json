        "en_US": "The Soul Killer, after killing most creatures, will collect their souls into the sword. As a certain type of soul is collected more, the sweeping damage and range against that type of creature will slowly increase.\\nRight Click will consume 1 point of all types of souls to heal oneself.\\nThe durability of the Soul Killer is very low, but every kill will fully restore its durability.\\nYou need a wooden sword with exactly 666 soul power to craft it."
