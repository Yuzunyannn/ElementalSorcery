        "en_US": "It seems that the Relic Guard is a weapon made in ancient. The purpose is unknown. Each time it spell a skill, HP will be consumed. When HP is lower than a certain level, it will become damaged, and the core will become very unstable and explode. At this time, the core can be taken out through the Shock Wand. The Core determines the element type of the Relic Guard and creature can login as master in The Core.\\nSo, the Elf craftsman has analyzed the core and made the Relic Wheel, which can repair the damaged Relic Guard, and can login in The Core ( hold core and wheel, right click)."
